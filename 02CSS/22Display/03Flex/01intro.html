    <h2>Display Flex</h2>
    <p> The flexible box layout module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a <strong> one-dimensional layout model </strong>, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.</p>
    <p> When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time â€” either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the <strong>two-dimensional model </strong>of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.</p>
