            <h2>Q. 1 What is Redux?</h2>

            <h3>React Redux</h3>

            <p> Redux is a free and open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. The user interface in
                React is built with Redux. Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark were the first to launch it in 2015.
            </p>
            <p> React Redux is the official React Redux binding. It enables React components to read data from a Redux
                Store and send Actions to the Store in order to update data. Redux aids app scaling by providing a
                logical mechanism to manage state via a unidirectional data flow model. React Redux is fundamentally
                straightforward. It subscribes to the Redux store, checks to see if the data your component requires has
                changed, and then re-renders your component.
            </p>
            <p> Flux influenced Redux. Redux researched the Flux architecture and eliminated superfluous complexity.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Redux lacks the Dispatcher idea.</li>
                <li>Redux only has one store, whereas Flux has several.</li>
                <li>Store will receive and handle the Action objects directly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why should you use React Redux?</h3>

            <p>The primary reasons for using React Redux are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li> The official UI bindings for react applications are React Redux. It is kept up to date with any API
                    updates to ensure that your React components behave normally.
                </li>
                <li>It promotes 'React' architecture.</li>
                <li> It performs various performance optimizations inside, allowing components to re-render just when
                    necessary.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Redux Architecture</h3>

            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/reactjs/images/react-redux-architecture.png" alt="img" />

            <p>The components of the Redux architecture are described further below.</p>

            <p> <strong> STORE: </strong> A Store is a location where you can see the current state of your application.
                It manages the application's state and has a dispatch(action) method. It functions as the brain for all
                moving parts of Redux.
            </p>

            <p> <strong> ACTION:</strong> An action is a payload that is sent or dispatched from the view. Reducers can
                read it. It is a simple object designed to store information about the user's event. It contains
                information such as the type of action, the time of occurrence, the location of occurrence, its
                coordinates, and the state that it seeks to modify.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Reducer :</strong>reads the payloads from the actions and then updates the store via the state.
                To return is a pure function.
            </p>

            <h3>Installation Redux</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Requirements:</strong>React Redux requires React 16.8.3 or a later version.
            </p>

            <p>
                Install the following command to utilize React Redux with a React application.
            </p>

            <div>
                <p>$ npm install redux react-redux --save</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Q. 2 What is Redux Thunk used for?</h2>

            <h5>
                Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to return functions from Redux
                rather than just actions. This enables delayed activities, such as working
                with promises.
            </h5>

            <p>
                One of the main applications for this middleware is to handle asynchronous
                actions, such as utilizing axios to submit a GET request. We can use Redux
                Thunk to dispatch those actions asynchronously and resolve each promise
                that is returned.
            </p>

            <h3>Installation and Configuration</h3>

            <p>
                Redux Thunk may be installed from the command line using npm install
                redux-thunk --save or yarn add redux-thunk.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because it is a Redux utility, you must also have Redux installed. It is
                activated after installation by calling applyMiddleware():
            </p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>
                        import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'; <br />
                        import thunk from 'redux-thunk'; <br />
                        import rootReducer from './reducers/index'; <br />
                        <br />
                        const store = createStore( <br />
                        rootReducer, <br />
                        applyMiddleware(thunk) <br />
                        );
                    </code>
                </div>

                <h3>How to Make Use of Redux Thunk</h3>

                <p>
                    After installing Redux Thunk and include it in your project with
                    applyMiddleware(thunk), you can begin dispatching actions
                    asynchronously.
                </p>

                <p>Here's an example of a simple increment counter:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>
                        const INCREMENT_COUNTER = 'INCREMENT_COUNTER'; <br />
                        <br />
                        function increment() { <br />
                        return { <br />
                        type: INCREMENT_COUNTER <br />
                        }; <br />
                        } <br />
                        <br />
                        function incrementAsync() { <br />
                        return dispatch => { <br />
                        setTimeout(() => { <br />
                        // You can invoke sync or async actions with `dispatch` <br />
                        dispatch(increment()); <br />
                        }, 1000); <br />
                        }; <br />
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Here's how to configure success and failure behaviors after polling an
                API:
            </p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>
                        const GET_CURRENT_USER = 'GET_CURRENT_USER'; <br />
                        const GET_CURRENT_USER_SUCCESS = 'GET_CURRENT_USER_SUCCESS'; <br />
                        const GET_CURRENT_USER_FAILURE = 'GET_CURRENT_USER_FAILURE'; <br />
                        <br />
                        const getUser = () => { <br />
                        return (dispatch) => { //nameless functions <br />
                        // Initial action dispatched <br />
                        dispatch({ type: GET_CURRENT_USER }); <br />
                        // Return promise with success and failure actions <br />
                        return axios.get('/api/auth/user').then( <br />
                        user => dispatch({ type: GET_CURRENT_USER_SUCCESS, user }), <br />
                        err => dispatch({ type: GET_CURRENT_USER_FAILURE, err }) <br />
                        ); <br />
                        }; <br />

            <h2>
                Q. 3 What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?
            </h2>

            <p>
                A component is a fundamental building part in React. In other words, every
                application you create in React will be built up of bits known as
                components. However, React has two kinds of Components:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>1. React.PureComponent:</strong> It is one of the most important
                methods for optimizing React apps. There is no need for the
                shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle Method when utilizing the pure component
                because the ReactJS Pure Component Class checks existing state and props
                with new props and states to determine if the component should re-render
                or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. React.Component:</strong>However, React.Component re-renders
                itself whenever the props supplied to it change, the parent component
                re-renders, or the shouldComponentUpdate() method is triggered. The React
                application is not optimized. They are simple and quick to construct, and
                they are ideal for very small UI views where a re-render would be
                insignificant. They offer clearer code and fewer files to manage.
            </p>

            <p><strong>When should you use React.PureComponent?</strong></p>

            <p>
                You have the option of using React.If any of the following circumstances
                are met, PureComponent will be preferred over React.Component:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The state/properties object should be immutable.</li>
                <li>There should be no hierarchy between states and properties.</li>
                <li>When data changes, you should call forceUpdate().</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Making a React Application:</h3>

            <p>
                <strong> Step 1: </strong>Run the following command to create a React
                application:
            </p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>npx create-react-app functiondemo</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                <strong> Step 2: </strong> After creating your project folder, i.e.
                functiondemo, use the following command to navigate to it:
            </p>
            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>cd functiondemo</code>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Project Structure:</strong> It will look like the following.</p>
            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201212224551/ProjectStructure.png"
                alt="img" />

            <p>
                <strong>In this example</strong>, we will create a name color application
                that changes the text color when the component is presented in the DOM
                tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>App.js:</strong> Add the following code to the App.js file. App is
                our default component, and that is where we have written our code.
            </p>

            <h2>Q. 17 What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is
                its purpose?</h2>

            <h3>In React.js, use the Optional Second Parameter of setState.
            </h3>

            <p>Functions in my code that relied on a state would render with an earlier state rather than the updated
                one. This is due to the fact that setState is asynchronous. If I tried to console.log() a state before
                and after changing it, I would wind up logging the prior state. Assume that the value of
                event.target.value was 'hooray' and that the remainder of the App Component was properly configured in
                the following code snippet:
            </p>

            <h3>Example 1:</h3>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>
                        class App extends Component { <br>
                        this.state = { <br>
                        sampleItem: 'test', <br>
                        } <br>
                        handleChange = (event) => { <br>
                        <br>
                        console.log(this.state.sampleItem) // step 1 <br>
                        <br>
                        this.setState({ <br>
                        sampleItem: event.target.value // step 2 <br>
                        }) <br>
    
                        console.log(this.state.sampleItem) // step 3 <br>
                        };
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>


            <p>This code would generate the following output:</p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>test <br>
                        test</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Again, this is due to the fact that setState is asynchronous. When handleChange is called in response to
                an event, steps 1 and 3 occur before the state may be altered in step 2. Because sampleItem hasn't been
                updated from 'test' to 'hooray' yet, 'test' is printed twice. </p>

            <p>To address this issue, we may provide setState with an optional second parameter that is a callback
                function. This function is called immediately after setState completes setting a new state. If we
                rearrange our code as follows:</p>

            <h3>Example 2:</h3>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>
                        class App extends Component { <br>
                        this.state = { <br>
                        sampleItem: 'test', <br>
                        } <br>
                        handleChange = (event) => { <br>
                        <br>
                        console.log(this.state.sampleItem) // step 1 <br>
                        <br>
                        this.setState({ <br>
                        sampleItem: event.target.value // step 2 <br>
                        }, () => console.log(this.state.sampleItem)) // step 3 <br>
                        }; <br>
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>We get the desired outcome printed out:
            </p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>test <br>
                        hooray</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>As the optional second parameter in Example 2, I used an anonymous arrow function. This anonymous
                function is invoked immediately after setState completes setting the new state to 'hooray' and prints
                out the new state.
            </p>

            <p> This solves the asynchronous nature of setState. Rather than merely printing out a new state, we could
                easily construct a more complicated callback function that makes use of our new state. So, in Example 2,
                step 3 may look like this:</p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>() => SomeComplexCallbackFunction(this.state.sampleItem)
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This enables us to conduct actions quickly following a state change and be confident that whatever data
                we return will use the most recent state.
            </p>

            <h3>React Context API vs. Redux & useReducer
            </h3>

            <h3>Benefits of Redux
            </h3>

            <p>Why would you add another library for state management? I thought React already managed the state? That
                is correct, but imagine you have multiple components and pages, each of which must fetch data from
                various APIs and data sources and manage the state of how the user interacts with that data and the
                interface. Your app's state can quickly devolve into chaos. The following are the primary advantages
                that I have discovered:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Redux stores all of the state in one store, the single source of truth.</li>
                <li> Predictable: Because your program uses a single store, syncing your current state and actions with
                    other portions of your app is simple.</li>
                <li>Maintainability: Your code will be easier to maintain because Redux provides explicit standards on
                    how to structure it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1. Setup</h3>

            <p>Let's begin by making a new React app with the default settings: <span>$ npx create-react-app
                    redux-crud-app</span></p>

            <p>To begin, remove all files except App.js and index.js from the /src folder. Clear out App.js and just
                return one word for the time being. <span>$ npm run start</span> will launch the app.</p>

            <h3>2. Adding users from the state</h3>
            <h3>3. Creating a new user</h3>
            <h3>4. Changing a user's information</h3>
            <h3>5. removing a user</h3>
            <h3>6. Asynchronously loading new users</h3>


            <h3>App.js</h3>


            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>
                        function App() { <br>
                        return ( <br>
                        &lt;h1&gt;Hi&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
                        ); <br>
                        } <br>
                        <br>
                        export default App;
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Let's include a small CSS library to make our app appear great. For this article, I'll be using Skeleton
                CSS. Simply add the following line before the closing tag to index.html:</p>
            <span>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"
                href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/skeleton/2.0.4/skeleton.min.css" /&gt;</span>


            <p>On your localhost, the text should now be formatted. As a development dependency, let's install the
                standard React router package to handle our various pages:</p>

            <span>$ npm install react-router-dom --save
            </span>



            <h3>App.js</h3>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>import { Route, BrowserRouter as Router, Switch } from "react-router-dom"; <br>
                        <br>
                        import React from "react"; <br>
                        import { UserList } from "./features/users/UserList"; <br>
                        <br>
                        export default function App() { <br>
                        return ( <br>
                        &lt;Router&gt; <br>
                        &lt;div&gt; <br>
                        &lt;Switch&gt; <br>
                        &lt;Route path="/"&gt; <br>
                        &lt;UserList /&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/Route&gt; <br>
                        &lt;Route path="/add-user"&gt; <br>
                        &lt;h1&gt;Add user&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/Route&gt; <br>
                        &lt;Route path="/edit-user"&gt; <br>
                        &lt;h1&gt;Edit user&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/Route&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/Switch&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/div&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/Router&gt; <br>
                        ); <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>And add a the UsersList component for the layout:</p>

            <h3>2. Loading users from state</h3>

            <p>First we have to add the redux store to our application. Let's install react-redux and the redux toolkit:
            </p>
            <span> $ npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux --save</span>

            <p> Then create a file store.js with the following code:</p>

            <h3>store.js</h3>

            <div>
                <p>
                    import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"; <br>
                    <br>
                    export default configureStore({<br>
                    reducer: {},<br>
                    });<br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>We'll add Redux functions later to alter the state (reducers) here. We must now wrap our application
                within the store using Redux's provider wrapper:</p>

            <h3>index.js</h3>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>
                        import App from "./App"; <br>
                        import { Provider } from "react-redux"; <br>
                        import React from "react"; <br>
                        import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; <br>
                        import store from "./store"; <br>
                        <br>
                        ReactDOM.render( <br>
                        &lt;Provider store={store}&gt; <br>
                        &lt;App /&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/Provider&gt;, <br>
                        document.getElementById("root") <br>
                        ); <br>
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Next, let's create the redux state and populate it with our users. Then, within our UserList component,
                we'll retrieve this state.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Adding a new user</h3>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>import { useState } from "react"; <br>

            <p>We want to add the user to the state and return the user to the UserList component when they submit. If
                something goes wrong, we'll display an error message. </p>

            <p>To begin, we will add a method/function to our Redux user slice. This method, which Redux refers to as a
                reducer, is used to change the state. Inside reducers, our function receives the user state and the
                action, in this case the user form field values.</p>

            <p>Redux generates an action for us to use when using this function.</p>

            <p>To edit a user, we'll first link our edit button to the dynamic /edit-user/id page within our UserList
                component:
            </p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;Link to={`/edit-user/${id}`}&gt; <br>
                    &lt;button&gt;Edit&lt;/button&gt; <br>
                    &lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/p&gt; <br>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The new reducer will then be added to our Redux slice. It will look for the user in our state and update
                it if one exists.
            </p>

            <h3>usersSlice.js</h3>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>
                        const usersSlice = createSlice({ <br>
                        name: "users", <br>
                        initialState, <br>
                        reducers: { <br>
                        userAdded(state, action) { <br>
                        state.push(action.payload); <br>
                        }, <br>
                        userUpdated(state, action) { <br>
                        const { id, name, email } = action.payload; <br>
                        const existingUser = state.find((user) => user.id === id); <br>
                        if (existingUser) { <br>
                        existingUser.name = name; <br>
                        existingUser.email = email; <br>
                        } <br>
                        }, <br>
                        }, <br>
                        }); <br>
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Our EditUser.jsx file will look quite similar to AddUser.jsx, except that now we utilize the useLocation
                hook from react-router-dom to get the user id from the URL path:
            </p>

            <h3> 5. Deleting a user</h3>

            <p>I'd like to invite you to solve this one for yourself! It will be a good exercise to put what we've
                learnt so far into practice. </p>

            <p>My answer for the reducer is as follows:</p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>userDeleted(state, action) { <br>
                        const { id } = action.payload; <br>
                        const existingUser = state.find((user) => user.id === id); <br>
                        if (existingUser) { <br>
                        return state.filter((user) => user.id !== id); <br>
                        } <br>
                        },</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>6. Loading new users asynchronously</h3>

            <p>Warning: the following section is a little more difficult but extremely beneficial to understand!</p>

            <p> A useful feature would be the ability to import users from an external API. We'll make advantage of this
                free one: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
            </p>

            <p> Only synchronous code is executed by Redux. To handle async code, it was most popular to utilize a
                redux-thunk, which is simply a basic function that accepts async code as actions.</p>

            <p> Redux now provides a built-in capability for adding async code. Many tutorials still require
                redux-thunk, however redux's new configureStore function already includes this.</p>

            <p> Let us now include the API fetch in our usersSlice:</p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>export const fetchUsers = createAsyncThunk("fetchUsers", async () => { <br>
                        const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"); <br>
                        const users = await response.json(); <br>
                        return users;
                        });</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Then, within our slice, we'll add a property called <span>extraReducers</span>, which will have a couple
                of functions to handle the API's return:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>pending </li>
                <li> fulfilled</li>
                <li> rejected</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Our API call returns a Promise, which is an object representing the state of an asynchronous activity, in
                this case an API call. We'll update our status based on the Promise status.
            </p>

            <div class="">
                <div class="">
                    <code>const usersSlice = createSlice({ <br>
                        name: "users", <br>
                        initialState: { <br>
                        entities: [], <br>
                        loading: false, <br>
                        }, <br>
                        reducers: { ... }, <br>
                        extraReducers: { <br>
                        [fetchUsers.pending]: (state, action) => { <br>
                        state.loading = true; <br>
                        }, <br>
                        [fetchUsers.fulfilled]: (state, action) => { <br>
                        state.loading = false; <br>
                        state.entities = [...state.entities, ...action.payload]; <br>
                        }, <br>
                        [fetchUsers.rejected]: (state, action) => { <br>
                        state.loading = false; <br>
                        }, <br>
                        }, <br>
                        });</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This array of users should be retrieved as soon as our program loads and whenever a user clicks the LOAD
                USERS button.</p>
            <p> Let's dispatch it before our component inside index to load it as soon as our app loads.js:</p>

            <span>store.dispatch(fetchUsers())</span>

            <p>And to dispatch it on our button:</p>

            <span>onClick={() => dispatch(fetchUsers())}</span>

            <p>That's it! We finished building our CRUD app using React, Redux and Hooks.</p>
