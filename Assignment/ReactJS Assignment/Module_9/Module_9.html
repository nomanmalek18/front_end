            <h2>Q-1 What is React Js?</h2>

            <p>An open-source JavaScript package called React JS is used to create user interfaces, typically for mobile
                and single-page applications.</p>

            <p>In React, a user interface is constructed from components. Each of these elements is a user-defined
                Javascript function.</p>

            <p>These components can take props (properties) as inputs and return React elements that specify exactly how
                a certain piece of the UI (user interface) should look in response.</p>

            <p>Commonly referred to as the root node, a single HTML element serves as the foundation for most React
                applications.</p>

            <img src="assest/images/question_1_image.png" alt="Example-images">

            <p>The only method to "change" a React element is to render a new one on the screen because React elements
                are immutable (cannot be changed). React keeps track of all these element changes in a Virtual DOM.</p>

            <p>Calling the ReactDOM causes elements to be rendered on the screen.The createRoot() method compares the
                actual and virtual DOM elements with the least amount of modifications possible. In this diffing
                process, the ReactDOM always tries to avoid reloading the entire page, as demonstrated below:</p>

            <h2>Q-2. What is NPM in React Js?</h2>

            <p>The Biggest Software Registry (Library) in the World</p>
            <p>The biggest software registry in the world is npm.</p>
            <p>There are more than 800,000 code packages in the registry.</p>
            <p>To share software, open-source developers utilize npm.</p>
            <p>Npm is often used by businesses to control private growth.</p>

            <h3>Npm usage is free.</h3>
            <p>Use of npm is free.</p>
            <p>All npm public software packages are available for download without the need to register or log in.</p>
            <p>Software can be downloaded and installed using the <strong>CLI (Command Line Client) </strong> provided
                by npm.</p>

            <h3>Installing Node.js with npm</h3>
            <p>Node.js is installed before npm.</p>
            <p>This implies that in order to install npm on your machine, you must first install Node.js </p>
            <p>Visit the official Node.js website at <a href="https://nodejs.org">https://nodejs.org</a> to get the
                software.</p>

            <h3>Manager of Software Packages</h3>
            <p>When npm was first developed as a package manager for Node.js, it went by the moniker npm (Node Package
                Manager).</p>
            <p>Package.json files, which are used to define all npm packages.</p>
            <p>JSON must be used to format the package.json file's content.</p>
            <p>The name and version fields must both be included in the definition file.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <h3>Example:-</h3>
                <div class="example-code">
                    <p>
                        { "name" : "foo", <br />

            <h2>Q-3.What is Role of Node Js in react Js?</h2>
            <h3>The top 5 benefits of using React Node.js</h3>

            <p>Here are 5 reasons to utilize React and Node js to streamline web development and create highly
                effective, scalable code.</p>

            <h3>1. Contributes to keeping a high server load</h3>
            <p>The inclusion of Node in your React project makes it incredibly simple for servers to manage server load
                balancing and simultaneous network requests.</p>

            <h3>2. Aids in keeping real-time data current</h3>
            <p>The combination of React with Node js is quite helpful if your app requires real-time data handling or
                data streaming. This is so that Node can manage ongoing server connections and React can render data on
                the front end.</p>

            <h3>3. facilitates the creation of single-page applications</h3>
            <p>You can simply build single-page applications like Gmail and Facebook using React and Node js. Intuitive
                UI/UX creation is possible with React, and callback-based asynchronous data loading is offered by Node.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Make creating JSON for your APIs easier</h3>
            <p>The internet data serialization standard known as JSON, or Javascript Object Notation, aids in the
                communication of data between a website and a server.</p>

            <p>JSON API is helpful for improving consistency in JSON answer formatting, and its effective caching
                features can reduce unnecessary server queries. It is quite effective to use the JSON API with Node,
                which encourages code reuse. Using React, the reusable code becomes shareable.</p>

            <h3>5. MERN stack project technologies</h3>

            <p>MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js are the major four technologies used by the MERN Stack
                application. We can develop applications like e-commerce and financial websites using this stack. To
                create apps quickly, developers simply need to be familiar with Javascript and JSON in addition to
                MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React.js.</p>

            <h3>constructing a new program</h3>
            <p>There are several ways to construct React applications using construct React App.</p>

            <h3>npx script use.</h3>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>
                        npx create-react-app &lt;react-app-name&gt; npx create-react-app
                        hello-react-app

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>deciding on a template</h3>
            <p>Create React App uses the default template to create a React application. The original code having a
                specific built-in capability is referred to as a template. The npm package server offers hundreds of
                templates with a variety of ophisticated capabilities. Users of Create React App can choose a template
                by using the -template command line switch.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>create-react-app my-app --template typescript</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The cra-template-typescript package from the npm server will be used to create a react app using the
                command above.</p>

            <h3>setting up a dependence</h3>

            <p>As React uses the project structure suggested by npm and yarn, React dependency packages can be installed
                using the standard npm or yarn package commands.</p>

            <h3>use the package manager npm.</h3>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">

            </div>

            <h3>launching the program</h3>

            <p>Depending on the package management being used in the project, the React application can be launched
                using the npm or yarn commands.</p>

            <h3>use the package manager npm.</h3>

            <div class="example">

            <h2>Q.5 What is Components in React Js?</h2>

            <p> One of React's fundamental building blocks is the component. Or, to put it another way, every
                application you create with React will be built up of what are known as components. Using components
                makes creating user interfaces considerably simpler. You can see a user interface (UI) divided into
                numerous separate parts, or components, and work on them independently before merging them all into a
                parent component to create your final UI.
            </p>

            <p>
                As you can see in the figure below, we have dissected the GeeksforGeeks homepage's user interface into
                its component parts.
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230804155419/gfgdrawio-(1).jpg" alt="img"
                srcset="" />

            <p>
                React components essentially return JSX code that specifies what should be displayed on the screen.
            </p>

            <h3>Component types in ReactJS</h3>

            <p>
                There are primarily two categories of components in React:
                <strong>Functional Components:</strong> Javascript functions are what
                functional components are. Writing a javascript function allows us to
                build a functional React component. We shall discuss if these functions
                accept data as parameters later in the lesson. The example below
                illustrates a React component that is functionally sound:
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    &lt;p&gt;function demoComponent() { <br />
                    return (&lt;h1&gt; <br />
                    Welcome Message! <br />
                    &lt;/h1&gt;); <br />
                    }&lt;/p&gt; <br />
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> <strong>Class Components:</strong> Compared to functional components, class components are a little more
                sophisticated. While the class components can cooperate with one another, the functional components in
                your application are unaware of the other components. Data can be passed across class components by
                using the pass method. To develop class-based components for React, we can use JavaScript ES6 classes. A
                React component that uses classes is demonstrated in the example below:
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;class Democomponent extends React.Component { render() {
                        return &lt;h1&gt;Welcome Message!&lt;/h1&gt;; } } &lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> In the two instances above, we developed components that are identical to one another, and we also
                described the key distinction between a functional component and a class component. In subsequent
                lectures, we will learn more about the characteristics of class-based components.
            </p>

            <p> For the time being, bear in mind that we won't employ functional components until we are certain that
                they don't need to communicate or collaborate with any other components. This means that while we can
                combine several functional components under a single functional component, these components do not
                require data from other components.
            </p>

            <p> Class-based components can also be used for this purpose, although doing so is not advised because doing
                so will make your program less effective.
            </p>

            <h3>Component Rendering in ReactJS</h3>

            <p> User-defined component rendering is also possible with React. React allows us to start an element with a
                user-defined component and send this element as the first parameter to ReactDOM in order to render a
                component.The component can be passed as the first argument to the ReactDOM.render() method or rendered
                directly.
            </p>

            <h3> How to initialize a component to an element is demonstrated by the syntax below:
            </h3>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>const elementName = &lt;ComponentName /&gt;;</code>
                </div>

            <h2>Q.6 What is Header and Content Components in React Js?</h2>

            <p> An essential component of a website's design is the header. It represents the website's first
                impression. It offers practical links to other parts of the website that the user might find
                interesting. In this article, we'll use React.js and Material UI to build a working Header.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>Approach:</strong> We will start by using some installs to build a simple react app. Using
                Material-UI, we will create a new Header Component with some decoration. We'll use the Material UI App
                Bar, which offers screen titles, navigation, and actions, to construct a header. Additionally, we will
                require an internal ToolBar to set the settings of the child components and position them all
                horizontally. Then, by importing the freshly built Header into our default Home page, represented by the
                App.js file, we will make some modifications. Let's now begin to make this.
            </p>

            <h3>React Application Development And Module Installation:</h3>

            <p> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the command below to create a React application:
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>npx create-react-app foldername</code>
                </div>
            </div>


            <p> <strong>Step 2: </strong>Use the following command to move to your project folder after creating it,
                i.e., foldername:
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>cd foldername</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Execute the following command to install the material-ui modules after building
                the React.js application.
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>
                        npm install @material-ui/core <br />
                        npm install @mui/icons-material <br />
                        npm install @mui/material <br />
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> Create a new file called Header.js in the "src" folder of the project. We'll put our header component in
                this file. The revised <strong>project structure</strong> will now appear as follows:
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211210165458/prjstr.PNG" alt="" />

            <p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> The header component will now be created. We'll use the Material UI App Bar
                Component.The top App Bar offers information and options relevant to the active screen. Branding, screen
                names, navigation, and actions all use it. It can change into a navbar or an action bar for the current
                context. The Material UI Tool Bar functions in conjunction with the AppBar rather than separately like
                other Material UI components. The settings of the toolbar component are set to the child component,
                which aligns them all horizontally.
            </p>

            <h2> Q.7 How to install React Js on Windows, Linux Operating System? How to Install NPM and How to check
                version of NPM?
            </h2>

            <p> React JS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that uses components. It is applied to the
                development of quick and engaging user interfaces for web-based and mobile apps. React needs less coding
                and offers more functionality, making it simple to construct dynamic applications. Both large MNCs and
                recent startups use it.
            </p>

            <h3>Features of React:</h3>

            <p> 1. Reusable Components: Each component in a single React app has its own logic and code, but we can
                easily reuse components any number of times, saving developers' time and improving the effectiveness of
                their work.
            </p>
            <p> 2. Debugging: "React developer tools" make it simple to debug React applications.It is a browser add-on
                that works with both Chrome and Firefox.
            </p>

            <h3>Reactjs setup for Windows:</h3>

            <p> Install the Windows Node.js installer as the first step. Select this link. Install the LTS version
                (located on the left) here. Click the Next button until NodeJS is fully installed after being
                downloaded, keeping all other settings in tact.
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211013203755/node1.png" alt="img" />

            <p> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter the command -> in the command prompt to see if it has been fully
                installed or not.
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>node -v</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211013203241/cmd1.jpg" alt="img" />

            <p> It will provide you with the installed version if the installation completed smoothly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Execute the following command on the terminal:</p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>npm install -g create-react-app</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211013211354/cmd2.jpg" alt="img" srcset="" />

            <p> React will be installed for you worldwide. Run the command to verify that everything worked as planned.
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>create-react-app --version</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015190556/cmd3.png" alt="img" />

            <p> It will provide you the installed version of the React app if everything went correctly.
            </p>
            <p> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Presently Using the command below, create a new folder where you want to create
                your react app:
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>mkdir newfolder</co>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> <strong> Note:</strong> The name of the folder, newfolder, in the command above can be anything.
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015194724/Img3.jpg" alt="img" />

            <p>Use the following command to move inside the same folder:</p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>cd newfolder (your folder name)</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015195432/IMG5.png" alt="img" />

            <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Execute the command -> inside this folder.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>create-react-app reactfirst YOUR_APP_NAME</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015201442/immgg.jpg" alt="" />

            <p>The installation of the necessary components will take some time.</p>
            <p> <strong>NOTE:</strong> Names can no longer contain capital letters due to npm naming constraints;
                therefore, type your app's name in lowercase.
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230202202100/gfg-react-improve-2.PNG"
                alt="img" />

            <p> <strong>Step 6:</strong> Now open the IDE of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to
                the folder where you installed the React app. The folder will be called Newfolder in the example above,
                and inside it your project's name, reactapp, will be displayed. Use the terminal to navigate to the
                folder for your app name.Use the command cd reactapp (the name of your app).
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015203027/img75.jpg" alt="img" />

            <p>
                <strong>Step 7:</strong> Execute the following command to launch your app:

            <h2>Q.8 How to check version of React Js?</h2>

            <p> A front-end Javascript library called React is used to create single-page applications (SPAs).
                Understanding the version can help you check for updates, understand the features that are currently
                available, and make sure that other dependencies are compatible. We will look at many ways to check the
                ReactJS version in this article.
            </p>

            <p> We'll go over three approaches to determine the React version in this article.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>package.json file usage</li>
                <li>command line use</li>
                <li>Using React's default import's version property</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>using the package.the json file</h3>

            <p> Our project's metadata is contained in the package.json file. When we build our React project, it is
                automatically created. Using the command listed below, we can produce a react application.
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>npx create-react-app name_of_the_app</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> Numerous name/value pairs in JSON format are found in the package.json file. As seen in the image below,
                we can quickly check the version of React by looking at the list of dependencies.
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210923161201/packageoutput.png" alt="" />

            <h3>Command line usage:</h3>

            <p> The command listed below can be used on our command line to quickly check the React version.
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>npm view react version</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> Below is a description of the output showing how to use the aforementioned command on the command line.
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210923161200/cmdversion.png" alt="" />

            <strong>Using React's default import's version property: </strong>

            <p> The object that is imported by default from the React library has a version attribute. This property can
                be used inside our JSX elements whichever we like.
            </p>

            <p>Syntax: The version property's syntax is listed below.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>import React from 'react'; let a = React.version</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> Create a react project using the command that was covered in the article above in order to follow along.
            </p>

            <p> the App.js file The code below shows how to use the version property on a React object and includes a
                description of the App.js file's contents.

            <p> When working on a single page application, changing the state of a React component is helpful since it
                allows the user to see new content without having to reload the page.
            </p>

            <p> The initial state value must be set in the constructor method, and the element whose click causes the
                state to change must have its click event handler defined. After that, give the function to the click
                handler and use setState to modify the component's state inside the function. The setState function is
                used to modify the component's state either directly or through the callback method described below.
            </p>

            <h3> Syntax: </h3>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>this.setState({ stateName : new-state-value})</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>this.setState(st => { st.stateName = new-state-value })</code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> <strong>Example 1:</strong> Using this example, you can see how to modify the component's state after a
                click.
            </p>

            <h3> index.js:</h3>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;import React from 'react' <br />
                        import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'<br />
                        import App from './App'<br />
                        <br />
                        ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;,
                        document.querySelector('#root'))&lt;/p&gt;<br />
                    </code>
                </div>
