                <h2>JSON and JavaScript</h2>

                <h3>What is JSON?</h3>

                <p>JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation. So is JSON JavaScript? Not exactly. <strong>JSON is a
                        data
                        format that is independent of any </strong><strong>programming language</strong><strong>,
                        although
                        it is derived from</strong><strong>JavaScript</strong>. The bulk of modern programming languages
                    contain code that can generate and parse JSON data.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>A few notes on JSON:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data</li>
                    <li>The syntax is self-describing, making it easy for humans to read and understand</li>
                    <li>Typically, JSON is used when data is sent from a server to a web page&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

                <p>JSON data is structured in two basic ways: a key/value pair or a collection of such pairs, or an
                    ordered
                    list. JSON allows six different types of data to be stored or transported, including:&nbsp;</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Array</li>
                    <li>Null</li>
                    <li>Boolean</li>
                    <li>String&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Number&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Object</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As you can see, JavaScript and JSON are two completely different things. While JSON is derived from
                    JavaScript, the two are not exactly comparable in any way. However, we can compare JSON to
                    JavaScript
                    objects. These two are more closely related, and they offer us a better comparison.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>What are JavaScript Objects?</h3>
                <p>JavaScript objects are also used to store data. <strong>All
                    </strong><strong>JavaScript</strong><strong>
                        values are actually objects with the exception of primitive data types</strong>, null, Boolean,
                    number, string, symbol, and undefined. JavaScript objects can get complex because they can contain a
                    number of different primitive data combinations.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>JavaScript objects are also structured in key/value pairs. They can be created by object constructor
                    syntax,object literals, constructors, and prototypes. JavaScript objects are mutable. This means
                    that
                    you can change the value for a respective key in a key/value pair.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>JSON Vs. JavaScript Objects: What are the Differences?</h3>

                <p>Before we look at the ways in which JSON and JavaScript objects differ, it is important to understand
                    that JSON and JavaScript objects are far more similar than they are different. JSON is derived from
                    JavaScript object literal syntax. In fact, the simplest explanation would be that <strong>JSON is
                    </strong><strong>JavaScript object</strong><strong> literal syntax but with more
                        restrictions</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>JSON and JavaScript objects are both human-readable. They both give users a way to structure data,
                    and
                    they can both be used as the source for another source. When it comes to differences, JSON and
                    JavaScript objects differ in a few key ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Language dependency&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Text only&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>String vs. object</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Language Dependency</h3>

                <p>One of the biggest differences between JSON and JavaScript objects is the dependency on a programming
                    language. JavaScript objects are completely dependent on JavaScript. They wouldn’t work with any
                    other
                    programming language.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>On the other hand, <strong>JSON is supported by more than 50 different </strong><strong>programming
                        languages</strong>, including popular languages such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ruby</li>
                    <li>Perl</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This wide array of support makes JSON a flexible choice for data storage and transfer.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>Text Only</h3>

                <p><strong>JSON data</strong><strong> can only be presented in text</strong>. You cannot add comments or
                    other
                    lines of code to JSON. This rigidity is the reason why so many other programming languages can
                    generate
                    and
                    parse JSON.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>JavaScript objects can include other code such as functions and methods. This allows for a greater
                    degree
                    of
                    complexity and function.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>String Vs. Object</h3>

                <p>The last major difference between JSON and JavaScript objects is the way they are presented. JSON is
                    presented in a string. These are referred to as JSON strings. JavaScript objects can contain
                    strings,
                    but
                    they are, as their name suggests, objects instead of strings. Objects are more complex than strings.
                </p>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

                <p>The differences between JSON and JavaScript objects are slight and nuanced. Likely, your organization
                    won’t
                    have to worry about making a choice between these two unless you are a tech company working in web
                    development.</p>

                <p>If you need help determining what path is right for your organization, seek help from an app
                    development
                    partner. A partner can use their technical expertise and industry experience to help guide you
                    through
                    all of the critical decisions you will need to
                    make, and they can help you understand nuanced comparisons like JSON vs. JavaScript objects.</p>
