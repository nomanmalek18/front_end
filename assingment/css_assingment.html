            <h2>Q-1. What are the benefits of using CSS?</h2>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a style sheet that provides a set of style rules for defining the layout of HTML documents. By using CSS, you can control the colour of the text, style of fonts, spacing between paragraphs, size and layout of columns, background images as well as a variety of other effects.

            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a type of style sheet language that give web designers control over how an internet site interacts with web browsers, including how its HTML documents are formatted and displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key objective was to distinguish between the content of documents and their presentation, which includes design elements like colour, layout, and fonts. The design and aesthetics of an internet page are handled by CSS. You can adjust the text's colour, font style, paragraph spacing, column size and layout, among other things, by using CSS.

                CSS gives instructions to HTML on how to display a website so that users may see it. Let's take a quick look at CSS's advantages and disadvantages.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Advantages of CSS:-</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    With CSS, you only need to declare a repeating style for an element once and use it repeatedly because CSS will automatically apply the necessary styles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Devices can easily read CSS updates. There is a need for responsive web design because consumers use a wide variety of smart devices to visit websites online.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Easy for the user to customize the online page
                </li>
                <li>
                    It reduces the file transfer size.

            <h2>Q-2. What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h2>
                <h3>Disadvantages of CSS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        CSS, from CSS 1 to CSS3, causes misunderstanding among web browsers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The availability of security is limited.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If any compatibility issues arise after making the changes, we must verify them. All browsers are affected by the same change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The world of programming languages is challenging for novices and those who are not developers. Different CSS levels, such as CSS, CSS 2, and CSS 3, can be very confusing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When utilising CSS, cross-browser difficulties could arise.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Q-3. What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h2>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheet: CSS stands for this term. Its primary goal is to give the website some flair and fashion. Colour, layout, background, font, and border properties are available in CSS. Better content accessibility, increased flexibility and control, as well as the ability to specify presentational attributes, are all made possible by CSS features.</p>
            <p>
                ascading Style Sheet Level 3 is known as CSS3, and it is the most recent version of CSS. It is utilised to format, style, and organise websites. All current web browsers support CSS3, which has a number of new capabilities. The division of CSS standards into discrete modules that are easier to understand and use is CSS3's most significant feature.

            <h2>Q.4 Name a few CSS style components</h2>
            <p>The style of web pages using HTML elements is set using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It alters the properties of several web page elements, such as the background colour, font size, font family, colour, etc.</p>
            <p>The following list of three CSS types includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inline CSS</li>
                <li>embedded CSS</li>
                <li>external CSS</li>
            </ul>
        
                <p><b>Inline CSS:</b> Inline CSS is a style sheet that includes a CSS property in the body of an element. The style attribute of an HTML tag is used to specify this kind of style.</p>
        
                <p><b>Example:</b> This is an illustration of how inline CSS is used.</p>
        
                <p><b>Internal or Embedded CSS:</b> When a single HTML document needs to be styled uniquely, internal or embedded CSS might be employed. The head part of the HTML document should contain the CSS rule set, which is done by embedding the CSS within the style> tag.</p>
        
                <p><b>Example:</b>This illustrates how internal-css is used.</p>
        
                <p><b>External CSS: </b>External CSS consists of independent CSS files that, with the aid of tag attributes (such as class, id, heading,... etc.), only include style characteristics. CSS properties should be linked to the HTML content using a link tag and are written in a separate file with a.css extension. It implies that a style can only be set once per element and will be used consistently throughout web pages.</p>
        
                <p><b>Example:</b>CSS attribute can be found in the file provided below. The.css extension is used to save this file.
