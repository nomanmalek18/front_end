    <h1>Naming Conventions in Programming</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Naming Conventions</strong><br>
        JavaScript does not have any specific rules for naming variables; however, other languages do. Naming
        conventions help your code stay fluent within the context of your program. This is important because you
        want to have consistency throughout your entire program. Below you will find general rules when naming
        your variables.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Variables tend to start with a letter.</li>
        <li>Spaces are not allowed in variables</li>
        <li>Special characters such as “!,-,@” are not allowed in the name</li>
        <li>Digits are allowed but keep Rule number 1 in mind.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Example of valid names</p>
    <ul>
        <li>user</li>
        <li>total</li>
        <li>output</li>
        <li>results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example of invalid names</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Becky Johnson</li>
        <li>output!</li>
        <li>12Users</li>
        <li>first-name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Variable names should clearly express how the variable is going to be used. For example, the following
        names are valid but not typically a good idea to use:</p>
    <p>
        tuna = 32</p>
    <p> TheResultsFromACalculationWithALongName = ((32 + x) / 5)
    </p>

    <h1>10 JavaScript Naming Conventions Every Developer Should Know</h1>
        <p>June 13, 2023 UPDATED</p>
        <p>Following standard naming conventions increases readability and makes it easier to understand your
        code. However, many developers are not aware of how to use naming conventions correctly, and
        sometimes they make things complicated.</p>
        <p>In this article, I will discuss 10 JavaScript naming convention best practices you should follow.</p>
    <h2>1. Naming Convention for Variables</h2>
        <p>JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. Lowercase and uppercase letters are distinct. For
        example, you can define three unique variables to store a dog name, as follows.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>var DogName ='Scooby-Doo';</li>
            <li>var dogName = 'Droopy';</li>
            <li>var DOGNAME = 'Odie';</li>
            <li>console .log( DogName); // "Scooby-Doo"</li>
            <li>console .log(dogName); // "Droopy"</li>
            <li>console .log(DOGNAME); // "Odie"</li>
        </ol>
    <p>
        However, the most recommended way to declare JavaScript variables is with <strong>camel case</strong>
        variable names. You can use the camel case naming convention for all types of variables in
        JavaScript, and it will ensure that there aren't multiple variables with the same name.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <p>bad:-</p>
        <li>var dogname = 'Droopy';</li>
        <p>bad:-</p>
        <li>var dog_name = 'Droopy';</li>
        <p>bad:-</p>
        <li>var DOGNAME =<q>Droopy</q>;</li>
        <p>bad:-</p>
        <li>var DOG_NAME = 'Droopy';</li>
        <p>good:-</p>
        <li>var dogName = 'Droopy';</li>
    </ol>
        <p>
        The names of variables should be self-explanatory and describe the stored value. For example, if you
        need a variable to store a dog's name, you should use dogName instead of just Name since it is more
        meaningful.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <p>bad:-</p>
        <li>var d = 'Scooby-Doo';</li>
        <p>bad:-</p>
        <li>var name = 'Scooby-Doo';</li>
        <p>good:-</p>
        <li>var dogName = 'Scooby-Doo';</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>2. Naming Convention for Booleans</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to Boolean variables, we should use <strong>is</strong> or <strong>has </strong>as
        prefixes. For example, if you need a Boolean variable to check if a dog has an owner, you should use
        hasOwner as the variable name.</p>
    <p>bad:-</p>
    <li>var bark = false;</li>
    <p>good:-</p>
    <li>var isBark = false;</li>
    <p>bad:-</p>
    <li>var ideal = true;</li>
    <p>good:-</p>
    <li>var areIdeal = true;</li>
    <p>bad:-</p>
    <li>var owner = true;</li>
    <p>good:-</p>
    <li>var hasOwner = true;</li>

    <h2>3. Naming<strong> Convention for Functions</strong></h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript function names are also case-sensitive. So, similar to variables, the <strong>camel
            case</strong> approach is the recommended way to declare function names.
        </p>
    <p>
        In addition to that, you should use descriptive nouns and verbs as prefixes. For example, if we
        declare a function to retrieve a name, the function name should be getName.
    </p>
    <p>bad:-</p>
    <span>function name ( dogName, ownerName ) {
    <span>return</span> <span>'${dogName} ${ownerName}'</span>;
    }

    <p>good:-</p>
    <span>function</span> <span>getName</span>(<span>dogName, ownerName</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>'${dogName} ${ownerName}'</span>;
    }
    <h2>4. Naming Convention for Constants</h2>
    <p>JavaScript constants are also case-sensitive. However, these constants should be written in
        <strong>uppercase </strong>because they are nonchanging variables.
    </p>
    var</span> LEG = <span>4</span>;
    <span>var</span> TAIL = <span>1</span>;
    <span>var</span> MOVABLE = LEG + TAIL;</pre>
    <p>If the variable declaration name contains more than one word, you should use
        <strong>UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. </strong>
    </p>
    <span>var</span> DAYS_UNTIL_TOMORROW = <span>1</span>;</pre>
    <p>All the constants should be defined at the start of your file, method, or class.</p>
    <h2>5. Naming Convention for Classes</h2>
    <p>Naming convention rules for JavaScript classes are pretty similar to functions. We have to use
        descriptive titles that explain the class’s capabilities.</p>
    <p>The major difference between function and class names is that we have to use <strong>Pascal
            case</strong> for class names.</p>
    <span>class</span> <span>DogCartoon</span> {
    <span>constructor</span>(dogName, ownerName) {
    <span>this</span>.dogName = dogName;
    <span>this</span>.ownerName = ownerName;
    }
    }

    <span>var</span> cartoon = new DogCartoon(<span>'Scooby-Doo'</span>, <span
       >'Shaggy'</span>);</pre>
    <h2>6. Naming Convention for Components</h2>
    <p>JavaScript components are widely used in front-end frameworks like React. Although components are
        used in the DOM, treating them similarly to classes and using <strong>Pascal case </strong>to define
        names is recommended.</p>
    // bad
    function dogCartoon(roles) {
    return (
    &lt; <span>div</span> &gt;
    &lt; <span>span</span> &gt; Dog Name: { roles<span
        >.dogName</span> } &lt; /<span>span</span>&gt;
    &lt; <span>span</span> &gt; Owner Name: { roles<span
        >.ownerName</span> } &lt; /<span>span</span>&gt;
    &lt; /<span>div</span>&gt;
    );
    }

    // good
    function DogCartoon(roles) {
    return (
    &lt; <span>div</span> &gt;
    &lt; <span>span</span> &gt; Dog Name: { roles<span
        >.dogName</span> } &lt; /<span>span</span>&gt;
    &lt; <span>span</span> &gt; Owner Name: { roles<span
        >.ownerName</span> } &lt; /<span>span</span>&gt;
    &lt; /<span>div</span>&gt;
    );
    }</pre>
    <p>Since the initial letter is always written in uppercase, a component stands out from native HTML and
        web components when utilized.</p>
    <span >div</span>&gt;</span>
    <span >&lt;<span >DogCartoon</span>
        <span >roles</span>=<span>{{</span> <span >dogName:</span>
        '<span >Scooby-Doo</span>', <span >ownerName:</span> '<span
            >Shaggy</span>' }}
        /&gt;</span>
    <span >&lt;/<span >div</span>&gt;</span></pre>

    <h2>7. Naming Convention for Methods</h2>
    <p>Although there are some differences, the structure of a JavaScript function and a method are pretty
        similar. So, naming convention rules are the same.</p>
    <p>We must use <strong>camel case </strong>to declare JavaScript methods and use verbs as prefixes to
        make names more meaningful.</p>
    <span >class</span> <span>DogCartoon</span> {
    <span>constructor</span>(<span>dogName, ownerName</span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>dogName</span> = dogName;
    <span>this</span>.<span>ownerName</span> = ownerName;
    }

    <span>getName</span>(<span></span>) {
    <span >return</span> <span>'${this.dogName} ${this.ownerName}'</span>;
    }
    }

    <span >var</span> cartoon= <span >new</span> <span
    >DogCartoon</span>(<span>'Scooby-Doo'</span>, <span
       >'Shaggy'</span>);

    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(cartoon.<span>getName</span>());
    <span>// "Scooby-Doo Shaggy"</span></pre>
    <h2>8. Naming Convention for Denoting Private Functions</h2>
    <p>Underscores ( _ ) are widely used in languages like MySQL and PHP to define variables, functions, and
        methods. But in JavaScript, an underscore is used to denote private variables or functions.</p>
    <p>For example, if you have a private function name like toonName, you can denote it as a private
        function by adding an underscore as a prefix (_toonName).</p>
    <span >class</span> <span>DogCartoon</span> {
    <span>constructor</span>(<span>dogName, ownerName</span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>dogName</span> = dogName;
    <span>this</span>.<span>ownerName</span> = ownerName;
    <span>this</span>.<span>name</span> = <span
    >_toonName</span>(dogName, ownerName);
    }
    <span>_toonName</span>(<span>dogName, ownerName</span>) {
    <span >return</span> <span>`<span>${dogName}</span> <span
        >${ownerName}</span>`</span>;
    }
    }

    <span >var</span> cartoon = <span >new</span> <span
    >DodCartoon</span>(<span>'Scooby-Doo'</span>, <span
       >'Shaggy'</span>);

    <p>good:-</p>
    <span>var</span> name = cartoon.<span>name</span>;
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(name);
    <span>// "Scooby-Doo Shaggy" </span>

    <p>bad:-</p>
    name =cartoon.<span>_toonName</span>(cartoon.<span>dogName</span>, cartoon.<span>ownerName</span>);
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(name);
    <span>// "Scooby-Doo Shaggy"</span></pre>
    <h2>9. Naming Convention for Global Variables</h2>
    <p>For global JavaScript variables, there are no specific naming standards.</p>
    <p>It is recommended to use <strong>camel case</strong> for <strong>mutable</strong> global variables
        and <strong>uppercase </strong>for<strong> immutable </strong>global variables.</p>

    <h2>10. Naming Convention for File Names</h2>
    <p>Most web servers (Apache, Unix) are case-sensitive when it comes to handling files. For example,
        <strong><em>flower.jpg</em></strong> isn’t <strong><em>Flower.jpg</em></strong>.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, web servers, such as Microsoft’s IIS, do not care about the case. In such servers,
        you can use <strong><em>Flower.jpg</em></strong> or <strong><em>flower.jpg</em></strong> to access
        <strong><em>Flower.jpg</em></strong>.
    </p>
    <p>However, if you switch from a case-insensitive server to a case-sensitive server, even a tiny mistake
        can cause your website to crash.</p>
    <p>So, it is recommended to use <strong>lowercase</strong> file names in all servers despite their
        case-sensitive support.</p>
