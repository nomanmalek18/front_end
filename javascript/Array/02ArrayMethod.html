            <p> Objects allow you to store keyed collections of values. That's fine.</p>
            <p> 
                But quite often we find that we need an ordered collection, where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on.  For example, we need that to store a list of something: users, goods, HTML elements etc.
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                It is not convenient to use an object here, because it provides no methods to manage the order of elements. We can't insert a new property “between” the existing ones. Objects are just not meant for such use.
            </p>

            <h3> There exists a special data structure named Array, to store ordered collections.</h3>

                <p>let arr = new Array();</p>
                <p>let arr = [];</p>
                <p>let arr = [123,74,89,152,512];</p>

            <h3> Array is a special kind of object, suited to storing and managing ordered data items.
            </h3>
            <p> The declaration:</p>
            <p>// square brackets (usual)</p>
            <p>let arr = [item1, item2...];</p>
            <p>// new Array (exceptionally rare)</p>
            <p>let arr = new Array(item1, item2...);</p>
            <p>The call to new Array(number) creates an array with the given length, but without elements.</p>
